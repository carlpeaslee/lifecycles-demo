*Overview*

During this course, we are going to improve our understanding of the way React makes updates to the DOM, gain experience using each of React's lifecycle methods, and use our experience to optimize a component for performance.

For this course, we are going to work to improve the performance of an application that I built in another course about es6 syntax.

Let's take a second to check out the app I built.


Currently, you can try the component out, live on the internet at plot.cool/lifecycles.

Plot.Cool is a small web app that uses highlight js to let you create your own markup language.

After working as both a programmer and a creative writer, I was intrigued by the idea of combining the colorful syntax highlighting of ides with regular english prose.

On the left, you can see we have the ability to create new rules about how to highlight text. When we create a rule, our code searches text in the input field and applies a classname to our text that matches the name of the rule.

Then, we can dynamically create our own styles for each of those rules.

Our input field allows us to input our own text –– or we can toggle this option here at the top to go get a random piece of literature from an api...
