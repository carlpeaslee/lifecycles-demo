*Overview*

One of the other tools we're going to be using is a library called `react-addons-perf` –– perf being short for performance.

Perf gives us a number of functions that allow us to monitor the behavior of our components.

Here we can take the start and stop functions and put them where we want to start and end our  monitoring. And then we use another function like showinclusive to genreate a report.
